# JPMorgan-Chase-Bank-Schedule-Staffing-Tool

This app helps JPMorgan Chase Bank Managers find other JPMorgan Chase Employees in a local geographic location that can help with coverage for staffing issues.
For instance, a manager may require additional staffing coverage for his/her bank because an employee called out sick and is unable to come into work.
This app tool help managers find part-time employees who are willing to cover and work extra hours. Part-time employees are able to post
their contact information and availability. If the availability matches the manager's needs then he or she can contact the employee for coverage.
